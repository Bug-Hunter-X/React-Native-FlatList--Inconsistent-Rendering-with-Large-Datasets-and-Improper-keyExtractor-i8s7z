This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and involves improper handling of the `keyExtractor` prop. If the `keyExtractor` function doesn't return unique keys for each item, or if it returns keys that change over time, the FlatList might exhibit unexpected behavior such as incorrect rendering or performance issues.  This can lead to items not rendering, disappearing, or being duplicated unpredictably.  The problem is particularly hard to debug because it's often intermittent and depends on how the data is being updated or reordered.
